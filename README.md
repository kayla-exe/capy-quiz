## Site Owner Goals
- To provide the user a casual, comfy experience to challenge their capybara knowledge.
- To maintain user engagement with an interactive experience throughout the entire quiz app.
- To entice the user to return to the quiz app to improve their score.

## User Stories
- ### First Time User
  - As a first time user I want the quiz to be informative, accurate and engaging.
  - As a first time user I want a clear visual of when I select the correct answer, or when I select the incorrect answer; for the site to show me which answer was correct.
  - As a first time user I want to be able to see my score at the end of the quiz, and also restart the quiz with my new knowledge and increase my score.

- ### Returning User
  - As a returning user I want to be able to retake the quiz infinitely until I finally get a perfect score.

## Design

### Imagery
The imagery and graphics used were both given careful considering to ensure they compliment the entire 'feel' of the quiz app. A simple cartoon style was used to give a playful, carefree feel
to the site. A simple capybara icon was choosen for the favicon, and casual icons and graphics of capybaras were used throughout.

### Color Scheme
- The color scheme of the site was chosen to not only not strain the user's eyes, but also to tie in with the nature of the quiz.
- The decision to make the full background of webpage light green was to increase user accesibility. Too many bright whites against stark dark colors can easily strain the user's eyes, and
  would make the user less likely to return.
- The quiz app area was kept simple and clean, with thematic dark green buttons. It allowed the information to be displayed clearly, while also keeping in theme.

### Fonts
The Sour Gummy font was chosen to be used throughout the entire website. This font was imported from ((GOOGLE FONTS)). Sour Gummy is a playful font, again tying in to the casual, comfy feel of 
the website. Sans serif was selected as a backup in case, for any reason, the main font would not display clearly.

## Features
- ### Logo and Title
    - The landing page of the website has a very simple layout which includes a H1 heading stating the name of the quiz, as well a simple capybara graphic. Just below is another simple H1 statment
      encouraging users to test their knowledge by completing the quiz.

- ### Interactive Buttons
    - The multiple choice answers are placed in 4 interactive buttons for the user to select. As the user hovers a button, their cursor becomes a 'pointer', easily conveying that these buttons are able to clicked
      and interacted with. Once one of the buttons is clicked, another button cannot be pressed. This is to disallow the user from changing their answer, and potentially 'cheating'.
